# Angular Shared Service

This is a simple example of an Angular application and library which share a singleton service through providers.

The library sets `"Hello"` to `"World"` in `PropertyBagService`, the application sets `"Foo"` to `"Bar"` and finally `AppComponent` renders all entries in the property bag into a table after initializing.
